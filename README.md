# Health-and-Fitness-Club-Management-System

A Health and Fitness Club Management System web application using SQL, Javascript, HTML and CSS. This system will serve
as a comprehensive platform catering to the diverse needs of club members, trainers, and administrative staff.

<h1>Objective</h1>
Design and implement an application for a Health and Fitness Club Management System. This system will serve
as a comprehensive platform catering to the diverse needs of club members, trainers, and administrative staff.
Members should be able to register and manage their profiles, establish personal fitness goals (you can
determine suitable fitness goals such as weight and time, and members will set the values), and input health
metrics. They should have access to a personalized dashboard that tracks exercise routines, fitness achievements,
and health statistics. Members can schedule, reschedule, or cancel personal training sessions with certified
trainers. Additionally, they should be able to register for group fitness classes.
Trainers should have the ability to manage their schedules and view member profiles.
Administrative Staff should be equipped with features to manage room bookings, monitor fitness equipment
maintenance, update class schedules, oversee billing, and process payments for membership fees, personal
training sessions, and other services.
